At this moment
We're waiting for the flame to be burning
Looking at the sparkle stars
Count down from the infinite
Until now, we're here together

In the ancient times
We warred each other spending our countless souls
Since when father became the god
They turned the killing into the games
And today, we win it with the glory

Give me your hand, and clap for me
Without your shouting I cannot sing

Give me your hand, and hold me up
No matter what can't break me down

Give me your hand, and pray for me
Even reality far from the dreams

Give me your hand, and trust me do
Give me your hand, to make me strong enough to break
